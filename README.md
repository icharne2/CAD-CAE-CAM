# CAD-CAE-CAM
This repository contains basic model files and simulation results created using CAD, CAE, and CAM software.
Files in Solidworks:
- `heat_cooling_simulation_solidworks` -> This file contains a 3D model used for simulating heat exchange during the cooling process of hot-rolled coils in SolidWorks. The geometry consists of multiple layered coils created with linear patterning and includes reference axes for thermal analysis. The model is prepared for transient thermal simulation with appropriate material properties, boundary conditions, and mesh settings
